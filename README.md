# group_23_project

Final project for the R for Bio-Data Science course (22160) - Group 23

The original data used for this project comes from the following study available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes/data?select=77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv), but can also be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/BCPP/BreastCancerProteomes/tree/master).

More specifically for this project we will be using the following files:

-   77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv

-   PAM50_proteins.csv

-   clinical_data_vreast_cancer.csv

The data files are not included in the GitHub repository, as specified in the project requirements, instead the data is retrieved directly from the [GitHub](https://github.com/BCPP/BreastCancerProteomes/tree/master) repository where these can be found.

The R folder contains all the scripts done for this project.
