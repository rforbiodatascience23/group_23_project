# group_23_project

Final project for the R for Bio-Data Science course (22160) - Group 23

The original data used for this project comes from the following study available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes/data?select=77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv), but can also be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/BCPP/BreastCancerProteomes/tree/master).

More specifically for this project we will be using the following files:

-   77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv: includes iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). In this file, we have a set of level-expression proteins analysed in the different breast cancer individuals.

-   PAM50_proteins.csv: PAM50 classification system (relevant for further analysis)

-   clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv: contains information related to the samples

The data files are not included in the GitHub repository, as specified in the project requirements. as the data could not be retrieved automatically from any web server, if you wish to execute this project end-to-end, you must download the correspondng files inside the `/data/_raw/` directory. End-to-end execution also requires having the following packages installed:

-   tidyverse

-   ggrepel

-   broom

-   clusterProfiler(`BiocManager::install("clusterProfiler")`)

The R folder contains all the scripts done for this project.
