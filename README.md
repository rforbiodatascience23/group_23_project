# group_23_project
Final project for the R for Bio-Data Science course (22160) - Group 23

The original data used for this project comes from the following study available in: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayush9753/singlecell-rnaseq-data-from-mouse-brain/data

The raw dataset consists in two separated .csv files from a single cell RNA-Seq study in brain cells of mouses (Tabula Muris). The two files are for the counts from every sample and gene analysed on the RNA-seq experiment, and a metadata file. The data files are not included in the GitHub repository, as specified in the project requirements.

The R folder contains all the scripts done for this project.
