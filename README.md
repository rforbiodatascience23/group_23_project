# group_23_project

Final project for the R for Bio-Data Science course (22160) - Group 23

The original data used for this project comes from the following study available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes/data?select=77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv), but can also be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/BCPP/BreastCancerProteomes/tree/master).

More specifically for this project we will be using the following files:

-   77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv: includes iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). In this file, we have a set of level-expression proteins analysed in the different breast cancer individuals.

-   PAM50_proteins.csv: PAM50 classification system (relevant for further analysis)

-   clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv: contains information related to the samples

The data files are not included in the GitHub repository, as specified in the project requirements, instead the data is retrieved directly from the [GitHub](https://github.com/BCPP/BreastCancerProteomes/tree/master) repository where these can be found.


The R folder contains all the scripts done for this project.
