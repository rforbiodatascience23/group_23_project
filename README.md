# group_23_project
Final project for the R for Bio-Data Science course (22160) - Group 23

The original data used for this project comes from the following study available in: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes/data?select=77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv

The raw dataset consists in three separated .csv files from a breast cancer proteome study. There is a main file with the iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). In this file, we have a set of level-expression proteins analysed in the different breast cancer individuals. In addition, we have two additional files: one metadata file containing information related to the samples, and another with a list of genes and proteins used by the PAM50 classification system (relevant for further analysis).

The data folder witht the raw and processed files are not uploaded in the GitHub repository (as specified in the project requirements).

The R folder contains all the scripts done for this project.
