## 01. Loading the raw data

Raw data has to be downloaded to `/data/_raw` directory from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes/data/). The data could not be retrieved automatically from the server, and the data will not be loaded in the project repository on GitHub. If you are executing this end-to-end be sure that the `77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv` is unzipped in your own \_raw directory.

```{r}
PAM50 <- read.csv("../data/_raw/PAM50_proteins.csv")
proteomes_77 <- read.csv("../data/_raw/77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv")
clinical <- read.csv("../data/_raw/clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv")
```
